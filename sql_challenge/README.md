Background
Itâ€™s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
Perform 
1. Data Modeling (Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like QuickDBD)
2. Data Engineering (Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Be sure to create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.)
3. Data Analysis
